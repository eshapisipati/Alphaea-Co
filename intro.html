    <h2>
        About Us
    </h2>


    <h3>
        Our Mission
    </h3>
    <p>
        The main goal of Alphaea is to
        empower menstruators to take control
        of their flow and subsequently their
        lives.At Alphaea & Co. we are
        determined to improve access to high
        quality, sustainable, and affordable
        menstrual products.
    </p>

    <h4>
        How we started
    </h4>
    <p>
        <strong>
            "Does anyone have a pad or tampon?"
        </strong>

        A question that every person who
        menstruates has heard and asked
        themselves. And many times the answer
        is no. Alphaea & Co hopes to bridge
        this gap by helping to provide free,
        sustainable, and accessible menstrual
        products so that question never needs to
        be asked again.

    </p>

    <h3>
        Our Goals
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Gender Affirming Care
    </h4>
    <p>
        Not all menstruators are women and not
        all women menstruate. With this in mind
        we aim to provide gender affirming care to
        all menstruators while promoting products
        and companies that promote gender neutrality for their products.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Ending Period Poverty
    </h4>
    <p>
        Menstruating isn't optional. So why are there so few resources for menstruators in need? We at Alphaea recognize the issues with the current system and are working to fix these gaps. In the meantime we can connect you with places to donate products and find free and/or affordable products in your area.
    </p>
