        What we do
    </h3>
    <p>
        It's pretty simple. We provide free
        period and menstrual products. You may
        be wondering how and that's a great
        question - we partner with many amazing
        companies that provide sustainable and
        gender neutral products and we place them
        in our associated schools, offices, and
        other public places so that these amazing
        products are significantly more accessible
        and available to a larger amount of people!
